# to start the project we use
<!-- django-admin startproject django_project -->

# to change the directory we use:
<!-- cd filename -->

# change directory to project/filename:
<!-- cd django_project/ -->

# after this got the file and view there will be a project present in file..

<!-- add that entire file to code editor.. -->
<!-- and in that we have settings/init/url/wsgi/manage files.. -->

# Some of the files we find once the directory is found.

<!-- init: this is the file where it shouws it is pyhton file project..

settings : this is the file that where our security and some predefined application given by django is stored..

url: this is the section where our all page urs will be stored..[admin/], where we can use the admin section using "www.our.application.admin/"

wsgi: this is the file which is used to connect the python and the web appilication.. -->


# once after this we need to run:

<!-- python manage.py runserver -->
# which gives us the localhost server 127:0:0:1:8000 port

where we can acces this link and check..
we can change the link to

<!-- 127:0:0:1:8000 -->

we can check for admin block as we have in url-file,

<!-- localhost:8000/admin -->

# to set any new url of the page we can use url_py;

eg:

<!-- urlpatterns=[
    path('dashboard/', dashboard.site.urls),
] -->


after the use we can close our local host we can use:

<!-- CTRL C: to stop the server. -->

# to start the  django app we use command:

 <!-- python manage.py startapp blog -->  [we can check these command are available in help command]
        [BLOG is the file name u want to create..]

# once the file blog is created now we start building our application home page function
[ i am writing function to handle the traffic of the home page when user logins.. ]

for that we need to take responces from user, so we need to request for the user.

we need to import:
<!-- from django.http import HttpResponce --> this import will collect the respoce from the users..

# Creating the function home(request) which is used sen dthe request and collect the responce..

<!-- def home(request):
        return HttpResponse("<h1> hi this is home page </h1>") -->

Here we are handling the user when he comes to home page.

To redirect user we are creating a "urls.py" file, where we  map0 thebfunction for each view/page user view.

# this urls file will be same as "urls.py" we saw in under blogs.

# Create a file called urls.py and add the path to Home page.
