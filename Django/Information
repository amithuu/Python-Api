# to start the project we use
<!-- django-admin startproject django_project -->

# to change the directory we use:
<!-- cd filename -->

# change directory to project/filename:
<!-- cd django_project/ -->

# after this got the file and view there will be a project present in file..

<!-- add that entire file to code editor.. -->
<!-- and in that we have settings/init/url/wsgi/manage files.. -->

# Some of the files we find once the directory is found.

<!-- init: this is the file where it shouws it is pyhton file project..

settings : this is the file that where our security and some predefined application given by django is stored..

url: this is the section where our all page urs will be stored..[admin/], where we can use the admin section using "www.our.application.admin/"

wsgi: this is the file which is used to connect the python and the web appilication.. -->


# once after this we need to run:

<!-- python manage.py runserver -->
# which gives us the localhost server 127:0:0:1:8000 port

where we can acces this link and check..
we can change the link to

<!-- 127:0:0:1:8000 -->

we can check for admin block as we have in url-file,

<!-- localhost:8000/admin -->

# to set any new url of the page we can use url_py;

eg:

<!-- urlpatterns=[
    path('dashboard/', dashboard.site.urls),
] -->


after the use we can close our local host we can use:

<!-- CTRL C: to stop the server. -->

# to start the  django app we use command:

 <!-- python manage.py startapp blog -->  [we can check these command are available in help command]
        [BLOG is the file name u want to create..]

# once the file blog is created now we start building our application home page function
[ i am writing function to handle the traffic of the home page when user logins.. ]

for that we need to take responces from user, so we need to request for the user.

we need to import:
<!-- from django.http import HttpResponce --> this import will collect the respoce from the users..

# Creating the function home(request) which is used sen dthe request and collect the responce..

<!-- def home(request):
        return HttpResponse("<h1> hi this is home page </h1>") -->

Here we are handling the user when he comes to home page.

To redirect user we are creating a "urls.py" file, where we  map the function for each view/page user view.

# This "blog/urls.py" file will be same as "urls.py" in django_project.

# Create a file called "urls.py" under blog and add the path to Home page.

# to add the path we need to import files from "views.py" and "path" as well
<!-- from . import views
from django.urls import path -->

# we create a constructer as same as in "urls.py" in django_project.
<!-- 
urlpatterns = [
    path('',views.home, name='blog-home')
] --> 
# here '' is the extension path for the home page. and we are calling the home function from here.

# Then we need to connect "blog/urls.py" file into  "urls.py" in django_project.
<!-- we need to include import it comes with path as well.
    in urlpatterns constructer we can add another path. -->

<!--path('blog/', include('blog/urls)), -->

# once after this run the server and check.

# further if we need to add  more function's ex: about, we can just keep on adding in "blog/urls.py" and in the functions in "views.py" file.

in views:
<!-- def about(request):
        return HttpResponse("<h1> hi this is about page </h1>") -->

in urls.py:
    path('about/', views.py,name='about-page'),

# if we run trhe server we get both the page.[localhost:8000/blog/about] //for about page and [localhost:8000/blog/] //for home page.


<!-- ################################################################################ -->
# end of basics:
from line 200 advance:



















































# we cant keep creating functions for all so we are adding a single page to every single templates and the using the templates we are accesing each and every file.

# Create a folder under blog names "templates" and under templates create another folder "blog"
blog -> temaplates -> blog 

# create a file for each of the functions under blog folder.
blog -> temaplates -> blog ---// home.html


# once this is created go to "views.py" file 
# previosly we used to use HttpResponce for the accessing of the file, we can sue another function as we are rendering the file from another folder.. we use 
<!-- from django.shortcuts import render -->

# In ther created function home, change the return statement as 

<!-- return render(request,'blog/home.html') -->
        <!-- return HttpResponse("<h1> hi this is home page </h1>") -->
        <!-- return render(request, 'path of the file located')-->


# Lets try to access some dummy created by cerating a dummy data form the dictonary//
# we are passing the dummy data inside the list/dictornary so that using key:value we can access the data easily..

    ex: posts=[
       {
        'author': 'amith',
        'title': 'blog1',
        'dateposted': 'january'
    },
    {
        'hi':'hello',
        'wfh':'yes'
    }
    ]

# to access this data we need to create a list and an obj which is easier to access the above dummy data.

inside the function
ex: def home(request):
        context={
           #obj 'storealldata'=posts # dummy data list name.[all the data will be stored in the object]
        }
        return render(request, 'file path name', context)[render function accepts only 3 parameters so we are passing the context through ehich we can access the data.]

# the another thing in here we need to access the data in html file.// for that we use 
<!-- <body>
            {% for post in storealldata %}   # storealldata is the variable dictonary where we have stored our data
                <h1> {{post.author}}</h1>
                <p> {{post.title}}</p>
                <p>on {{post.dateposted}}</p>
            {% endfor %}  # ending of this very important
        </body> -->

# This is the another method, as we are writing the same lines of code several times we can make a static file where we can store a similary code and change once for all, when we needed.
# that is done by cerating an another file called "base.html" under "blog" 
        <!-- "templates->blog->base.html" -->

# once the file is created we add the repeated code to that file, and logic og each page in a "{block}"
for ex:
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>

        {% if title %}
            <title> learning {{title}}</title>
        {% else %}
            <title> started learning</title>
        {% endif %}

        <body>
            {% block content%} {% endblock content%}
        </body>

    </head>
</html> -->

# As in the home.html and the about.html there is an logic difference between the body so we are making it as block and all the other things as static.

# now in home page
# * first we need to extend the base.html file to home.html, so for that we use 
<!-- {% extends 'blog/base.html'%} -->
# * and next create a block where the logic has to be. {block}

for home page
<!-- {% extends 'blog/base.html'%} -->
<!-- {% block content%}
        {% for post in store %}
            <h1> {{post.author}}</h1>
            <p> {{post.title}}</p>
            <p>on {{post.dateposted}}</p>
        {% endfor %} 
      {% enbdblock content %}  -->

for about page
<!-- {% extends 'blog/base.html'%}
{% block content %} 
    <h1> this is about page </h1>
{% endblock content %} -->

# THE BIG USE OF THIS IS, WE NO NEED TO WRITE ALL THE THINGS JUST WE NEED TO MAKE CHNAGES IN BLOG WHERE IT WILL CHANGE IN ALL THE PAGES.

# To make our project little intresting  added some "html nav bar code" inside body and "main html" as well,  and  AS WE NEED CSS WHICH IS STATIC SO  CREATE A FOLDER CALLED :STATIC: INSIDE STATIC CREATE ANOTHER FOLDER CALLED :BLOG: AS IT IS OUR APP NAME, INSIDE THAT CREATE A MAIN.CSS FILE 

"BLOG -> STATIC -> BLOG -> .CSS FILE"

# after that run the server again so that css gets load..

# In main file that is "basic.html" we have given .about, /blog[which is not correct if anything chnages we need to chnage in all place]  so change the path to [url 'name of the file given in "views.html"] 
ex:

<!--   <a class = "navbar-item nav-link" href="{% url 'blog-home'%}">Home</a>
        <a class = "navbar-item nav-link" href="{% url 'blog-about' %}">About</a>

# creating a :admin-user: "Super User"













# We are creating the admin user for the admin acces which is Super User
<!-- To Create Super User we have a command "createsuperuser" -->
<!-- python manage.py createsuperuser -->
# Run the command by stopping the server

* Error[ an error will be generated beacuse of teh below reason.] 

    <!-- django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: auth_user -->

    # why error??
    # Since we havn't created a database that we user for this project!!

# creating a database is simple here, just we need to run few "Migration" command.

# ":migration": is basicly used to apply the changes to database.

Once we use migration as we haven't created databsed it adds some tables to the database , and then it allows "createsuperuser"

<!-- python manage.py makemigrations -->

# after running the command o/p will be "No Changed Detected" [as the migration is  creating database] !!! [if user have created database user will get changed displayed.!! ]


# To apply the changes in migrations need to run this command:
 <!--python manage.py migrate  -->
# [which helps the migrations to update]

# once after running above command now you can create your super-user:

<!-- python manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'chiku'): amith
Email address: amithtalentplace@gmail.com
Password: New@1234
Password (again): New@1234
Superuser created successfully. -->


# After this run the server again

# [ U will be able to watch the admin blof try login , once you enter click on users and username which u created!!]

U will get to see the Password: with some [#labels] which is the added more security in Django.

<!-- ex:
password: algorithm: pbkdf2_sha256 iterations: 600000 salt: MSw5ES**************** hash: Sp5B1i************************************** -->

[we can add users there /delete users / can provide the permission there itself.]



# Creting own Database:
 # [To work with the data base, jango has the excellent advantage which is "ORM" in it..]

 ORM: "OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPER": 
# We can access database easily using the objects, and we can access other database as well without changing the code.

# Using SQLlite for the devlopment and Postgres database for the production..

# any changed in the database or updation , will be done in "blog/model.py" file..


# In "models.py" where we wanna think what need to store in our database.[ can  create a user from here as well and add some more fields than in amdin page for the users]
# [to do all these we need a databse model, which is already created by the Django, can     inherit the models class.]
# [Can create our owm model as well.]]


# now we are creating a class/ which is Table called :Post: in which we are giving the column names we need.

class Post(models.Model):                     <!--[models.Model]-> using this we create a table in the database [for models we need to "import from django.db import models"] -->
    title=models.Charfeild(max_length=100)                   -> <!-- there are the attributes that we are adding to the table Post..-->
     author=models.TextFeild()                                -> <!--Charfeild and TextFeild are same but text feild doesnt has any limit.. -->
    date_posted = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now) -> <!-- For the date attribute provide date format, for "default" we need to "import timezone from django.utils" -->
    author = models.Foreignkey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE) -> <!-- author name we are taking form the "User" database table, so making it as ForignKey, and on_delete, means if the author gets delete in "User" table then just delete the name of the author from the Post table , dont delete the data form database. -->

ex:
class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    date_posted = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# after creating the file adding/creating the above database table

# We need to add it to the database , so for that we need to run the migrations

<!-- python manage.py makemigrations --> [which means make the changes in database.]

# after running this the Django, creates it folder as "migrations" under blog.
<!-- Migrations for 'blog':
  blog/migrations/0001_initial.py
